<h2><center>FAQ</center></h2>
<ul>
<li>No connected textures? -> look at the top of the modpage!</li>
<li>"made for an older version of Minecraft" -> just load the pack as normal and it should run fine unless mojang has made significant changes to their resourcepack format</li>
<li>Make sure you have the correct version for your version and correct version of Fusion</li>
<li>Addons? -> Right here: <a href="https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/mt-ct-d-a">MT-CT-D-A</a></li>
<li>Breaks with sodium without indium, this is mostly because sodium (not embeddium) changes the fabric rendering system so indium fixes that</li>
<li>Use in Modpacks is specified in the license (dont worry the license should be easy to read)</li>
</ul>

<h2><center>Why was CTM & Athena Compat Depricated?</center></h2>
<ul>
<li> Athena does not support some features required to make this</li>
<li> CTM mod has not updated in a while and is limited up to 1.19.2 and lower</li>
<li> This Pack has became Fusion only because 1.Can make fusion install automatically when you install this pack, 2.Ease of only having to maintain a resourcepack in 1 format and 3.Most people using this pack use fusion with it</li>
</ul>
